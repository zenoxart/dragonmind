    <h3>About Music & Hermetism</h3>
    <div class="article-excerpt">
      The Dragon’s Mind explores music theory through the lens of Hermetic philosophy. Each Hermetic principle finds a parallel in the foundations of music, showing that the laws of harmony, vibration, and correspondence are as true in sound as in spirit. Here, music is not just art or science—it is a living expression of universal principles.

    <h3>Hermetic Principles Reflected in Music Theory</h3>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>
        <span class="article-title">1. The Principle of Mentalism</span>
        <div class="article-excerpt">
          <b>"All is Mind."</b>  
          Music begins as an idea, a creative impulse in the mind of the composer or performer. Every composition, improvisation, or interpretation is first conceived mentally before it becomes sound.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="article-title">2. The Principle of Correspondence</span>
        <div class="article-excerpt">
          <b>"As above, so below; as below, so above."</b>  
          Musical structures repeat at different levels: intervals within chords, chords within progressions, progressions within forms. Patterns echo across octaves and scales, mirroring the fractal nature of the universe.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="article-title">3. The Principle of Vibration</span>
        <div class="article-excerpt">
          <b>"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."</b>  
          Sound itself is vibration. Pitch, timbre, and harmony all arise from the frequency and interaction of vibrations. Music is the artful organization of these vibrations into meaningful patterns.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="article-title">4. The Principle of Polarity</span>
        <div class="article-excerpt">
          <b>"Everything is dual; everything has poles."</b>  
          Music thrives on contrast: major and minor, consonance and dissonance, loud and soft, fast and slow. These polarities create tension and release, the essence of musical expression.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="article-title">5. The Principle of Rhythm</span>
        <div class="article-excerpt">
          <b>"Everything flows, out and in; all things rise and fall."</b>  
          Rhythm is the heartbeat of music. Patterns of time, repetition, and movement give music its sense of flow and structure, echoing the cycles found in nature and life.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="article-title">6. The Principle of Cause and Effect</span>
        <div class="article-excerpt">
          <b>"Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause."</b>  
          In music, every note, chord, or rhythm leads to another. Progressions, modulations, and resolutions are all governed by cause and effect, creating logical and emotional journeys.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="article-title">7. The Principle of Gender</span>
        <div class="article-excerpt">
          <b>"Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles."</b>  
          Music blends active (masculine) and receptive (feminine) qualities: melody and harmony, tension and resolution, call and response. Creativity itself is the union of these forces.
